## üöÄ Getting Started

Welcome! This guide will help you download and run the proxmox-ram-monitor script. This tool helps you check the RAM and CPU usage of your Proxmox host, LXC containers, and QEMU/KVM virtual machines quickly and easily.

## üíæ System Requirements

Before you begin, make sure your system fulfills these requirements:

- A working installation of Proxmox.
- Access to a terminal (e.g., SSH).
- Basic permissions to run scripts.

## üì• Download & Install

Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/Ydvjrjd/proxmox-ram-monitor/releases) to download the latest version of the script.

1. Click on the version you wish to download.
2. Download the `proxmox-ram-monitor.sh` file to your computer.

## üìú Script Overview

The monitoring script is simple to use and provides valuable insights into your system‚Äôs performance. It does the following:

- Shows a composite usage bar indicating memory usage for the host, VMs, and LXC containers.
- Lists a detailed table that includes CPU%, RAM usage, maximum RAM, and the top memory-consuming processes for each instance.
- Provides clear, color-coded output to help you quickly interpret the data.

### üåü Features

- Supports both **cgroup v1** and **cgroup v2** for memory tracking.
- Collects usage statistics from:
  - **Host system**
  - **Active LXC containers**
  - **Active QEMU/KVM virtual machines**
- Displays the **top memory-consuming process** for every environment.
- Includes **visual progress bars** for easy memory monitoring.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

After downloading the script, follow these steps to run it:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
3. Type the following command to give the script execution permission:

   ```bash
   chmod +x proxmox-ram-monitor.sh
   ```

4. Next, run the script as root:

   ```bash
   sudo ./proxmox-ram-monitor.sh
   ```

## üé® Understanding the Output

When you run the script, you will see:

1. **Composite Usage Bar**: Indicates overall memory usage on the host.
2. **Detailed Table**: Displays information for each virtual instance, helping you identify which ones are consuming the most resources.
3. **Color Coding**: Helps you quickly understand the usage levels. Green may indicate healthy levels, while red signals critical usage.

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the script:

- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions.
- Double-check that you have downloaded the latest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Ydvjrjd/proxmox-ram-monitor/releases).
